  <h1>Join the Team!</h2>

  <p>
  If you're actively interested in developing security related tools, auditing Android code, or writing exploits for Android vulnerabilities &#8212; this is the group for you.
  </p>

  <p>
  Joining the group is easy. The process starts by introducing yourself at: {{ site.join_email }}.
  </p>

  <p>
  NOTE: You can still contribute content via pull request, even if you don't have commit access!
  </p>

  <p>
  The next step is adding yourself to the 
  <a href="https://github.com/droidsec/droidsec.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml">_config.yml</a> file in the web site repository. You can probably even edit it right from the web site!
  If not, fork the project and checkout a copy locally:

{% highlight sh %}
$ git clone https://github.com/droidsec/droidsec.github.io.git droidsec
$ cd droidsec
$ $EDITOR _config.yml
$ git add _config.yml
$ git commit -m 'Add myself to the members list'
$ git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

  Once you've made your commit, go over to the GitHub web interface and make a pull request. We'll merge it and then you'll appear on the members list!
  </p>
